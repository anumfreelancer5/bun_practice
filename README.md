Bun Practice is a compact collection of utility functions designed to speed up everyday coding tasks. It focuses on common patterns in arrays, dates, objects, strings, and math. The library is written with TypeScript in mind and targets environments that use Bun as the runtime. It emphasizes small, fast, well-tested helpers that you can rely on in production code.

This repository houses a curated set of utilities that you can import directly into your projects. The goal is to provide simple, readable, and dependable building blocks for daily development work. The utilities cover a broad spectrum, from array manipulation to robust validation helpers. The design favors predictable behavior, small surface area, and strong typing to reduce bugs and improve developer experience.

If you are looking to streamline your workflow, Bun Practice can help you stay focused on the business logic. The functions are designed to be composable, making it easy to build higher-level logic from small, well-defined pieces. The project embraces a pragmatic approach: implement what you need, and keep the surface minimal and clear.

Key themes for this project include reliability, performance, and clarity. The utilities are crafted to be straightforward to understand and fast to execute. You will find a mix of low-level helpers and high-level utilities that fit naturally in TypeScript projects. The library aims to be a practical toolkit rather than a large framework.

About Bun Practice
Bun Practice is a lightweight toolkit of utility functions. It exists to help developers write fewer lines of code and avoid boilerplate. The library focuses on common patterns that appear across many projects. It offers consistent naming, clean APIs, and thoughtful error handling. The type definitions aim to be friendly and informative, guiding you toward correct usage without friction.

The project takes a practical stance on API design. Each function has a clear responsibility, a minimal API surface, and thorough test coverage. Type inference works well with TypeScript, so the types help catch mistakes early. You can rely on the functions to be predictable and easy to read in code reviews.

Quick start
Getting started is simple. You can download the latest release from the Releases page and begin using the utilities in minutes. If you encounter any issues or want to try out new features, check the Releases section for newer assets and changelogs. Visit the Releases page to see what's available and to download the appropriate asset for your platform.

From the Releases page, download the asset named bun_practice-1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz or an equivalent build for your platform. After downloading, extract the archive and follow the included installation steps. The asset is intended to be straightforward to install, with no complex setup required. If you run into platform-specific quirks, the documentation below provides guidance and workarounds.

How to use the utilities
- Import pattern: you can import specific helpers to keep your bundle small. For example, import { chunk, memoize } from "bun_practice".
- Naming: the functions use descriptive names. You should be able to guess what a function does by its name.
- Examples: use the functions to reduce repetitive tasks, improve readability, and keep logic focused on business rules.

Usage notes
- The library favors pure functions when possible. Pure functions produce the same output for the same input without side effects.
- Functions are designed to work well with TypeScript. If you rely on type inference, you will see helpful typings in your editor.
- You will find helpful runtime checks in debug builds. In production builds, you can enable a leaner path for performance.
